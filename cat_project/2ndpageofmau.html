 <h1 class="readable"> Just a whole bunch of cat yap hehe</h1>


<p class="textbox readable"> Everyone loves kitties of all kinds! The best types of kitties are obviously 
orange tabbys, tuxedos, and black cats though. Kittens are cutie pattoties, and when young you can 
get them used to cuddles, grooming, tricks, nail clipping and more! Tortitude is no joke, watch out 
for another really cute cat coloration: tortise shells. They are cute, chill, but can jus tweak out sometimes. 
Kitties awww they so cute. Always make sure to approach a cat with a pointed finger at nose level, 
makes the can think your finger is like another cat's nose, a greeting between two cats. Sniff sniff sniff 
they sniff, to greet eachother ofcourse. Sphynx cats are scary ima be honest. they still cats so they 
cute, but I like the cute fluffy babies more. Sphynx cats also leave behind eye booger stains which 
are the same color of mealworm/superworm blood after a day of airing out. yuck. Cute cats tho, wouldn't 
even try to take care of one tho because their care is very species specific! </p>
